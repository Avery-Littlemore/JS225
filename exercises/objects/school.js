// Create a school object. The school object uses the same kind of student object as the previous exercise. 
// It has methods that use and update information about the student. Be sure to check out the previous exercise 
// for the other arguments that might be needed by the school object. Implement the following methods for the school object:

// addStudent: Adds a student by creating a new student and adding the student to a collection of students. 
  // The method adds a constraint that the year can only be any of the following values: '1st', '2nd', '3rd', '4th', or '5th'. 
  // Returns a student object if year is valid otherwise it logs "Invalid Year".
// enrollStudent: Enrolls a student in a course.
// addGrade: Adds the grade of a student for a course.
// getReportCard: Logs the grades of a student for all courses. If the course has no grade, it uses "In progress" as the grade.
// courseReport: Logs the grades of all students for a given course name. Only student with grades are part of the course report.
// To test your code, use the three student objects listed below. Using the three student objects, produce the following values from 
  // the getReportCard and courseReport methods respectively.

// Examples of created student objects with grades; methods on the objects are not shown here for brevity.
// The following are only showing the properties that aren't methods for the three objects
